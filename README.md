# Web Sport Data Overlay

Supports three file formats: FIT, GPX, and TCX. It can be used to create dashboard videos with background color filtering, and the generated videos have a frame rate of 1 frame per second.
The project is fully built with JavaScript.
This project relies on the professional rendering capabilities of the [leafer-ui](https://github.com/leaferjs/leafer-ui) graphics framework and the excellent performance of [Mediabunny](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny).
Thanks to the ongoing contributions of the Mediabunny project, it now supports exporting WebM format videos with transparent channels.
WebM videos with transparent channels can be edited with [Shotcut](https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut).
